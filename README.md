# Festival Builder
Festival Builder is both a web and mobile application built with React Native and TypeScript. The application allows users to build their own festival by searching and selecting artists through Spotify's API. The goal is to build your festival by staying within budget, based on the size fest you choose in the beginning. Artists all have a cost to book them and their cost is determined by their monthly listeners.

## Spotify API

To use the Spotify API add a .env file in the root directory. In the .env file, add your ClientId and ClientSecret variables for your own spotify API credentials. The rest of the code will work by pulling in these variables.

## Installation Instructions
Clone this repository to your local code editor.

## Usage
To start the application, run: npx expo start

This will launch the Expo development server and you can open the app in your emulator or on a physical device using Expo Go.
